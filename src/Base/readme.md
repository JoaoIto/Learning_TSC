# Base for TypeScript

***TypeScript* is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.**


## What is TypeScript?


### JavaScript and More

TypeScript adds additional syntax to JavaScript to support a tighter integration with your editor. Catch errors early in your editor.

### A Result You Can Trust

TypeScript code converts to JavaScript, which runs anywhere JavaScript runs: In a browser, on Node.js or Deno and in your apps.

### Safety at Scale

TypeScript understands JavaScript and uses type inference to give you great tooling without additional code.

All of these dependency managers support lockfiles, ensuring that everyone on your team is using the same version of the language. You can then run the TypeScript compiler using one of the following commands:
